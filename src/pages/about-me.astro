      <h1 class="mb-7">Hey there! üëã</h1>
      <p class="mb-7">Welcome to my new website! My name is Alisha Nakamura and I am a hairstylist, hair educator, and mentor of over 6 years, most of which spent at an upscale salon in down Seattle, WA where I have worked for the past 6 years.</p>
      <div class="bg-shiftUp shadow rounded inline-block w-56 float-right bg-aboutMe2 bg-cover bg-top h-72 ml-6 my-4"></div>

      <p class="mb-7">In addition to providing a wide range of hair styling services to my clients, I have also had the opportunity to train and mentor apprentices in the industry.</p>
      <p class="mb-7">
        I am passionate about being a hairstylist because I truly love making people happy. There is something special about taking care of our physical appearance that helps us feel respected and dignified, and I am dedicated to helping my clients
        achieve the look they desire.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-7">
        Growing up in Japan, where salons are a common sight on every block, has had a significant impact on my approach to styling. The Japanese place a strong emphasis on being well-groomed and presentable at all times, and this focus on perfection
        has definitely rubbed off on me as a stylist. I am not satisfied until my pursuit of technical precision leads to my clients' happiness and satisfaction.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-shiftUpSm shadow rounded inline-block w-56 float-left bg-aboutMe1 bg-cover bg-top h-72 mr-6 my-2"></div>

      <p class="mb-7">
        As a hair educator and mentor, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and experience with the next generation of stylists. I believe that it is important to give back to the industry and help those who are just starting out on their own
        journey as hairstylists.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-7">
        I have a wide range of skills and experience in the beauty industry, and I am confident in my ability to provide exceptional service to every client. Thank you for considering me as your stylist, and I look forward to the opportunity to work
        with you and help you feel your best!
