      <h1 class="mb-7">Hey there!</h1>
      <p class="mb-7">Welcome to my new website! My name is Alisha Namakura and I am a hairstylist of over 6 years, most of which has spent an upscale salon in downtown Seattle, WA.</p>
       <p class="mb-7">
        I am passionate about being a hairstylist because I truly love making people happy. There is something special about taking care of our physical appearance that helps us feel respected and dignified, and I am dedicated to helping my clients
        achieve the look they desire.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-7">
        Growing up in Japan, where salons are a common sight on every block, has had a significant impact on my approach to styling. The Japanese place a strong emphasis on being well-groomed and presentable at all times, and this focus on perfection
        has definitely rubbed off on me as a stylist. I am not satisfied until my pursuit of technical precision leads to my clients' happiness and satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-7">
        I have a wide range of skills and experience in the beauty industry, and I am confident in my ability to provide exceptional service to every client. Thank you for considering me as your stylist, and I look forward to the opportunity to work
        with you and help you feel your best!
